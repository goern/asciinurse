*Doctor*, I will keep your HTML5 clean, and convert to it whenever you change an Asciidoc file.

= Her mission

She is a little tool, that will monitor your asciidoctor working directory 
for changes and convert the file set to html5 over and over again.

== Implementation

She is implemented using docker to separate the asciidoctor software
stack from the system, because we dont like software polution. 

So what asciinurse really is: a Fedora 21 based installation of 
asciidoctor, ascidoctor-diagramm and guard.

= Usage

To start asciinurse's service just run 'sudo docker run --rm -t -i -v
`pwd`:/data cgoern/asciinurse' within the directory you have your 
asciidoctor stuff in... it should download a few image layers on 
first start (like 1.4GB sorry for that). And hopefully it is available 
on your local docker registry, if not: build it.

If you now change some stuff and save the file, she will take care of
it an convert it to HTML5.

Stop the service container by ctrl-c or just start it in the background.

Afterwards you may want to put a handy alias in your .bashrc, something 
like `alias asciinurse='sudo docker run --rm -t -i -v $PWD:/data asciinurse'`
