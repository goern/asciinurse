*Doctor*, I will keep your HTML5 clean, and convert to it whenever you change an Asciidoc file.

= Her mission

She is a little tool, that will monitor your asciidoctor working directory 
for changes and convert the file set to html5 over and over again.

Asciinurse is free software and is licenced under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2 (GPLv2).

= Usage

To start asciinurse's service just run `docker run --rm -t -i -v
$PWD:/data -v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime b4mad/asciinurse` within the directory you have your 
asciidoctor stuff in... it should download a few image layers (it's hosted/build on hub.docker.com) on 
first start (like 1.4GB, sorry for that). And hopefully it is available 
on your local docker registry, if not: build it or pull it!

If you now change something within your Asciidoc and save the file, she will take care of
it an convert it to HTML5.

Stop the service container by ctrl-c or just start it in the background.

Given all that, you may want to put a handy alias in your .bashrc, something 
like `alias asciinurse='docker run --rm --tty --interactive -v $PWD:/data -v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime b4mad/asciinurse'`

== Implementation

She is implemented using a container to separate the asciidoctor software
stack from the system, because we dont like software polution and love service containers.

So what asciinurse really is: a Fedora 21 based installation of 
asciidoctor, ascidoctor-diagramm and guard.

= Changes

I try to keep log of the changes and try to use some https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Style-of-Change-Logs.html[GNU-like style].

=== Version 1.2.0 (2015-06-18)
* added
  http://asciidoctor.org/docs/convert-asciidoc-to-pdf/[asciidoctor-pdf]
  so that we can use `docker run --rm -t -i -v $PWD:/data -v
  /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime asciinurse asciidoctor-pdf -v
  <SOMEFILENAME>` to convert from adoc to pdf

=== Version 1.1.1 (2015-06-16)
* changed the Dockerfile to be based on Fedora 22

=== Version 1.0.2 (2015-04-23)
* goern: added some more docs and bumped to Version 1.0.2

= TODO

* We need to add PDF generation again, maybe on ctrl-c ?
* add livereload so that browser gets updated on each
