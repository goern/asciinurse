*Doctor*, I will keep your HTML5 clean, and convert to it whenever you change an Asciidoc file.

== Her mission

She is a little tool, that will monitor your asciidoctor working directory 
for changes and convert the file set to html5 over and over again.

Asciinurse is free software and is licenced under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2 (GPLv2).

== Usage

For usage information please have a look at https://goern.github.io/asciinurse/[Asciinurse gitpage].

== Implementation

She is implemented using a container to separate the asciidoctor software
stack from the system, because we dont like software polution and love service containers.

So what asciinurse really is: a Fedora 21 based installation of 
asciidoctor, ascidoctor-diagramm and guard.

== Changes

I try to keep log of the changes and try to use some https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Style-of-Change-Logs.html[GNU-like style].

=== Version 1.3.0 (2015-06-18)
* goern: added a asciidoctor-pdf theme that will produce something that looks like a Red Hat Reference Architecture document. Many thanks to rlopez for providing the basics.

=== Version 1.2.0 (2015-06-18)
* added
  http://asciidoctor.org/docs/convert-asciidoc-to-pdf/[asciidoctor-pdf]
  so that we can use `docker run --rm -t -i -v $PWD:/documents -v
  /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime asciinurse asciidoctor-pdf -v
  <SOMEFILENAME>` to convert from adoc to pdf

=== Version 1.1.1 (2015-06-16)
* changed the Dockerfile to be based on Fedora 22

=== Version 1.0.2 (2015-04-23)
* goern: added some more docs and bumped to Version 1.0.2

== TODO

TODOs will be tracked using https://github.com/goern/asciinurse/issues[github issues].
